# Algorithm
Record the algorithm on leetcode depending on frequency.

#### [*1.Two Sum:*](https://github.com/xiaohai0520/Algorithm/blob/master/algorithms/1.%20two%20sum.py)
Use dictionary to save the reminder value and index.

#### [*2.Add Two Numbers:*](https://github.com/xiaohai0520/Algorithm/blob/master/algorithms/2.%20Add%20Two%20Numbers.py)
For two lists, add node by node and can use divmod function.

#### [*3.Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:*](https://github.com/xiaohai0520/Algorithm/blob/master/algorithms/3.%20Longest%20Substring%20Without%20Repeating%20Characters.py)
Use dictionary to save the index of each char, if meet the char already in dic.  
Make sure whether it appends before or afrer start position, update the start.   
Compare length each time if add a new char in dic.

#### [*2.Add Two Numbers:*](https://github.com/xiaohai0520/Algorithm/blob/master/algorithms/2.%20Add%20Two%20Numbers.py)
For two lists, add node by node and can use divmod function.
