## No.1 : [K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)  
**HEAP**.  
We can only use heapq.nsmallest function.   
We can also use the sort function to get the first k points.   

## No.2 : [Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)  
**DP**.  
DP array to level up the running time.
Recursive to save up space.

## No.3 : [Prison Cells After N Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/)  
**Dic and Array and loop or math**.  
Use the dic to find the loop.    
For math, there is a loop for number 14.   

## No.4 : [DI String Match](https://leetcode.com/problems/di-string-match/)  
**Math**.  
if I ADD left else add right.
