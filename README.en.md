LeetCode Solutions: A Journey of Problem Solving.

This repository is divided into Two parts for now:

- The first part is the solutions to some classic problems on LeetCode, including the idea thinkings, key points and code implementations.

- The second part is a summary of data structures and algorithms.



## About me


> Only when having mastered the basic data structures and algorithms can you solve complex problems easily.

The algorithms mainly includes:

- Basic skills: Divide-and-Conquer; Binary; Greedy
- Sorting algorithms: Quicksort; Merge Sort; Counting Sort
- Searching algorithms: Backtracking; Recursion; Depth-First-Search (DFS); Breath-First-Search (BFS); Binary Search Tree; etc.
- Graph theory: Shortest Path Problem; Minimal Spanning Tree
- Dynamic Programming: Knapsack Problem; Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Problem

The data structures mainly includes:

- Array and linked list: Singly/Doubly-Linked List
- Stack and queue
- Hash table
- Heap: Min-Max Heap
- Tree and Graph: Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA); Disjoint-Set
- String: Prefix Tree (Trie); Suffix Tree
